# Event Data Dreams - Directory
In this directory you can find different models, scenarios and assets you can use to run an event
data simulation using the Event Data Dreams package:
https://github.com/deepskydatahq/eventdatadreams

## Assets
The assets contain the data is used to populate properties. They are variants of a specific kind of data like products, marketing campaigns, browsers. The datasets are all generated by using GenAI models. If you are missing a dataset, try generate it and create a pull request, so we can add it to the directory.

## Models
These are the core of the simulations. In the events folder you can find all activities for each entity. The activities describe how state is handled, which contexts should be generated and used and most important which transition steps and propabilities are defined.

In the context folder you define, which contexts should be used for properties and how to generate them based on the asset data. The generation is mostly to create a random dataset that later will be used to pick a random item for a context that is used for properties.

## Scenario
This brings all together. Here you define the simulation run, which model is used, the time period, the number of daily sessions and the destinations where the data should be send to or saved.
